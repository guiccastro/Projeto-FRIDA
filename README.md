# downloader.py

This code can download the MRT data files from the Isolario, RouteViews or RIPE project from all of its collectors.

## Parameters:

### __Data type__:
``-t`` => Download RIBs data.

``-T`` => Download UPDATE data.

### __Begin and end date__:
``-B:year/month/day,hour:minute`` => The first data to be downloaded

``-E:year/month/day,hour:minute`` => The last data to be downloaded

### __Frequency__:
``-Fh:n`` => Download the data every ``n`` hours between the begin and end date.

### __Project__:
``-I`` => Download data from the project Isolario.

``-V`` => Download data from the project RouteViews.

``-R`` => Download data from the project RIPE.

### __Collector__:
``-I:a,b,c,...`` => Download the data from collectors ``a``, ``b``, ``c``, ..., from project Isolario.

``-V:a,b,c,...`` => Download the data from collectors ``a``, ``b``, ``c``, ..., from project RouteViews.

``-R:a,b,c,...`` => Download the data from collectors ``a``, ``b``, ``c``, ..., from project RIPE.

To download from all collectors from a project you just need to pass any collector in the parameter (e.g., to download from all collectors from Isolario, pass the parameter like '-I').

### __Number of parallel downloads__:
``-P:n`` => Download ``n`` parallel files from each project.

### __Path to save file__:
``-S:path`` => Save the downloaded files in ``path``.

## Example:
    $ python3 downloader.py -t -B:2021/04/01,00:00 -E:2021/04/02,20:00 -Fh:3 -V:saopaulo -P:3
  
In this example, you will download only RIB files from the project RouteViews of its collector SÃ£o Paulo. The files will be downloaded from the first day of April of 2021 until the second day of April of 2021, in every 3 hours. The code will download three files in the same time.

# sanitizer.py

This code will read the data from the MRT files, remove the ones with prefixes and routes invalids and create a new file with the sanitized data.

## Parameters:

### __Filter type__:

``-f`` => Filter by bogons.
``-F`` => Filter by fullbogons.

### __User list__:

``-L:path`` => Use a file given by the user to filter the data.

## Example:
    $ python3 sanitizer.py -F
  
In this example, the code will download the fullbogons based on the date from each MRT file and use them to filter the data.
